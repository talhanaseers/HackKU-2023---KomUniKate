**Inspiration - KomUniKate - About the Project:**

The inspiration behind KomUniKate came from the growing concern about online harassment and the need for a safer online space. In many online platforms, users often experience offensive or abusive comments that can be discouraging and intimidating. KomUniKate aims to mitigate this problem by using AI and machine learning to filter out inappropriate language in real-time, ensuring a more positive and respectful online communication experience.

**What We Learned:**

Developing KomUniKate was an incredible learning experience. We were able to improve our skills in natural language processing, web development, and machine learning. We also gained an understanding of how to implement a user-friendly web application that offers a reliable and effective solution to a real-world problem.

**How We Built Our Project:**

We built KomUniKate using a combination of Python, HTML5 & CSS3, JavaScript and JSON. We trained a deep learning model using TensorFlow, Keras, and Jupyter Notebook, and integrated it into a Flask-based web application. The user interface was designed using HTML5 and CSS3, providing a clean and intuitive user experience. The application was deployed on a cloud platform, allowing users to access it from anywhere with an internet connection.

**Challenges Faced:**

One of the main challenges we faced during the development of KomUniKate was the need for a large and diverse database to train our machine learning model effectively. We spent a significant amount of time collecting, cleaning, and preprocessing the data to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our model. Another challenge we faced was optimizing the application's performance and ensuring its scalability, as we wanted to make sure it could handle a high volume of requests without compromising its efficiency or accuracy.


Overall, building KomUniKate was a rewarding experience that allowed us to explore the potential of AI and machine learning in improving online communication. We hope that our project will inspire others to work towards creating a safer and more respectful online space for everyone.
